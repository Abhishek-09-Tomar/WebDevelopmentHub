# HTML Basics - Headings, Paragraphs, and Text Formatting

This document summarizes the concepts learned through the provided HTML
code.

## Headings (h1 to h6)

- **h1**: The most important heading. It is used for the website's
    main topic or name and helps with SEO.\
- **h2**: Used for main sections under h1.\
- **h3**: Used for sub-sections under h2.\
- **h4**: Used for smaller sub-sections under h3.\
- **h5**: Used for minor headings under h4.\
- **h6**: The least important heading, used for very small notes or
    sub-sections.

\## Paragraphs (

```{=html}
<p>
```

) - A paragraph is a block of text used to group related sentences
together.\

- It is mainly used to display normal readable text on a webpage.\
- Example: `<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...</p>`

## Text Formatting

- **center** : Aligns the text to the center.\
- **u** : Underlines the text.\
- **b** : Makes the text bold.\
- **i** : Makes the text italic.\
- **strong** : Defines important text (usually bold).\
- **br** : Inserts a line break.

\## Horizontal Rules (

```{=html}
<hr>
```

) - The `hr` tag defines a thematic break in a page.\

- It is displayed as a horizontal line separating content.\
- It is an empty tag, meaning it has no closing tag.

## Line Breaks (br)

- The `br` tag is used for a line break inside text or paragraphs.\
- Example: `This is <br> a line break.`

\## Preformatted Text (

```{=html}
<pre>
```

) - The `pre` tag is used to display preformatted text, such as poems or
code.\

- It preserves spaces, line breaks, and indentation.
