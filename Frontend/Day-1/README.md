# 🌐 HTML Basics – Structure & Tags

This README explains the **core structure of an HTML document** and the purpose of its main elements.

---

## 📜 Document Declaration

* **`<!DOCTYPE html>`**

  * This is the **document type declaration**.
  * It tells the browser that the document is an **HTML5 document**.
  * Not a tag, but an instruction to the browser.

## 🌍 Root Element

* **`<html>`**

  * Known as the **HTML root element**.
  * All other elements of the page are contained inside it.

## 🧠 The Head Section

* **`<head>`**

  * Contains elements that provide **information about the webpage**.
  * The contents of `<head>` are not directly visible on the webpage.
  * Typical elements inside `<head>` include:

    * **`<title>`** → Defines the title shown on the browser tab.
    * **`<meta>`** → Provides metadata such as character set, keywords, or viewport settings.
    * **`<link>`** → Used to link external resources such as stylesheets.
    * **`<style>`** → Embeds internal CSS styles directly in the document.
    * **`<script>`** → Adds JavaScript functionality to the webpage.

## 🏗️ The Body Section

* **`<body>`**

  * Encloses all the **visible content** of a webpage.
  * Everything you see in the browser (text, images, buttons, forms, etc.) is placed inside the body.

## 🔑 Commonly Used Tags

* **`<title>`**

  * Displays the **title of the page** on the browser tab.

* **`<h2>`**

  * Represents a **second-level heading**.
  * Used for subheadings after the main `<h1>`.

* **`<p>`**

  * Represents a **paragraph of text**.
