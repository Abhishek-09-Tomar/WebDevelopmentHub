## Difference Between Bold and Strong

- **Bold (`<b>`)**:  
  Simply makes the text thicker and darker. It's purely visual and has no semantic meaning.

- **Strong (`<strong>`)**:  
  Makes the text bold **and** indicates that the text is important. It carries semantic meaning, which helps browsers, screen readers, and search engines understand that the text is significant.
