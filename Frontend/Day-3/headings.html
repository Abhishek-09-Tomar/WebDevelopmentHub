    <h2>
        <center><u>Let's Talk About Headings and Why We Use Them</u>?</center>
    </h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Heading 1 (h1):</strong> The most important heading. It usually contains your website’s main topic
            or
            name and helps with SEO.</li>
        <li><strong>Heading 2 (h2):</strong> Used for main sections of a page. It organizes content under the h1
            heading.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Heading 3 (h3):</strong> Used for sub-sections under h2 headings. It helps break content into
            smaller
            parts.</li>
        <li><strong>Heading 4 (h4):</strong> Used for smaller sub-sections under h3. Useful for detailed topics.</li>
        <li><strong>Heading 5 (h5):</strong> Used for minor headings, usually under h4. Helps organize fine details.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Heading 6 (h6):</strong> The least important heading. Used for very small sub-sections or notes.
        </li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>if you want bigger heading size then you can adjust it with style tag like that : </p>
    <h2 style="font-size: 45px;">Heading : 2</h2>

    <h2>
        <center><u>Paragraph</u></center>
    </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            A paragraph is a block of text that groups related sentences together. In web pages, it is used to display
            normal text
            content.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>This is a paragraph : </h4>
    <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Temporibus perspiciatis cupiditate iure fugiat, aliquid
        sapiente ullam, officiis inventore provident nihil corrupti tenetur nemo similique perferendis illum sed, at
        quasi in. Asperiores, laborum?</p>

    <h2>
        <center><u>HTML Horizontal Rules</u></center>
    </h2>
    <p>The (hr) tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page, and is most often displayed as a horizontal rule.
        <br> <!--here br is used for the next-line or line-break. -->
        The hr element is used to separate content (or define a change) in an HTML page:
    </p>

    <h3><u>Example :</u></h3>
    <p>This is part one.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>This is part two.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>This is part three.</p>

    <p>
        <center><strong>NOTE </strong> : As you can see above we are dividing the three parts with the help of hr tag.
            That is why we are using this hr tag.
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The hr tag is an empty tag, which means that it has no end tag.
                </li>
            </ul>

        </center>
    </p>
    <hr>

    <h2><center><u>HTML Line Breaks</u></center></h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                br is used for line break.
            </li>

            <li>
                This is <br> a paragraph and having with a line break.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2><center><u>The Poem Problem</u></center></h2>

    <p><ul><li>For solving that problem we are going to use pre-tag.</li></ul></p>
    <pre style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;"><center>
    Open one eye only —
    the horizon is in the closed eye.
    Open the seashell —
    no solitude will escape.
    The stones on the riverbed drink up time,
    the dead fish swim towards the sun.
    Open one eye only.
    The world is a young tree on a building site,
    windows are rivers of our uncertainty.
    Open the sky.
    In my hands I keep a home —
    a prayer room in a hospital garden.</center></pre>
